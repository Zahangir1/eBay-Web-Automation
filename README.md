# eBay-Web-Automation
In this project I have automated https://www.ebay.com/ application using Selenium and TestNG. Written 6 Test cases including opening the URL, Click and Load , And play the drama without any errors. And also I have written Unit tests and stored the results in Log file, Captured screenshots and generated the entire test repors in a HTML document. Page Object Model is used, hence I have created separate Page objects for front page and Drama page.

And all other requirements are availabe in the pom.xml file
